Stargazing has been a hobby of me for some time. Started when I bought my new phone and took pictures of the sky with the shiny new High Megapixel camera of my phone. The time was August, I could not see many stars then due to not knowing where to look for them, but later found out the perfect place for finding those stars. My phone picked up enough stars to pique my interest. My dad used to tell me about stars when I was about 13, he knew the stars in Malayalam. The first bright spots I found on my Phone Camera were Saturn and Jupiter. Those aren't stars but were bright as stars in the night sky.

Later I checked the Stellarium app which gave me a better prespective about the night sky. Learned more about the constellations and the clusters.
