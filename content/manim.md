Manim is a Super cool Math Animation Engine by 3blue1brown. It has a difficult API and the lack of docs make it quite hard to make animations with it. 3b1b does a fantastic job at that though.

It's quite difficult to set up too. Requires a lot of deps and other stuff. I have barely scratched the surface and made a small trignometric animation with it.
