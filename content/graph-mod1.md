### Theorem 1.1 - HandShaking Theorem

It states that the sum of degree of vertices of a graph is twice the no. of edges of $G\ = (V,E)$ be a graph with $E$ edges then

$\sum deg_{G}(V)=2E$

### Theorem 1.2

The no of vertices of odd degree in a graph is always even

### Theorem 1.3

The maximum degree of simple graph with $n$ vertices is $n-1$

### Theorem 1.4

The maximum number of edges in a simple graph of $n$ vertices are $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$

### Theorem 1.5

If a graph*(connected or disconnected)* has exactly 2 vertices of odd degree, there must be a path joining the 2 vertices

### Theorem 1.6

A graph is disconnected *if and only if*  it's vertex set $V$ can be partitioned into two nonempty disjoint subsets $V_1 and\  V_2$ such that there exists no edge in $G$ whose one end end vertex is in subset $V_1$ and the other in subset $V_2$.

### Theorem 1.7

A simple graph with $n$ vertices must be connected if it has more than $\frac{\big[(n-1)(n-2)\big]}{2}$  edges



### Theorem 1.8

A simple graph(without $\parallel$ edges or self loops) with $n$ vertices and $k$ components can have at most  $\frac{(n-k)(n-k+1)}{2}$ edges
