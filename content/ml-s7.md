- Works with Data
- The more data, the better it is to learn from that data
- Machines analyzes large amount of data which humans can't
- ML is about teaching machines to learn the patterns and the machines can generate an algorithm to understand better

#### ML Model

1. Humans collect data from DBs or Spreadsheets \[Db/Sheet $\to$ Data\]
2. Data is used with an ML algorithm and is made into a ML model \[Data $\to$ ML Algorithm $\to$ ML Model\]
3. ML models is used on further data to give desired outputs \[ML Model $\to$ Data $\to$ Output\]

## SuperVised Learning

- Labeled Data + Labels $\to$ ML Model+Test Data $\to$ Predictions

## Unsupervise Learning

- Unlabeled Data -> ML Model -> Preditcions
- Learns from the Pattern in Data

## Reinforcement Learning

- Finds an optimal way to accomplish a particular goal or improve proformance
- Iterative
- Reward based Model
- Eg: Training a Dog

## Examples of ML Application

- Basket Analysis(Purchase Analysis)
